# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
''' 
Developed by: prakash
RegisterNumber:22004108 
'''
n1=int(input())
n2=int(input())
c=n1**n2
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",c)
```

## Output:
![exponentiation of a number](/OP.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
